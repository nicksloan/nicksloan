# Hi, I'm Nick Sloan

I’m the head of engineering at [Matter Neuroscience](https://matter.xyz), a company that aims to let you track and understand your happiness in the same way you might track your fitness. I am also the co-founder of [UpContent](https://upcontent.com/), and the founder of the Pittsburgh Python User Group.

I love software development and managing developers, and I’m at home as a part of a team of people working together to build something they love.

I’ve worked with companies of various shapes and size including [Faculty](https://faculty.com/), Apple, PNC, Samsung, [Simply Framed](https://simplyframed.com/), [Delve Fonts](https://delvefonts.com/), [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Tinybop](https://tinybop.com/), and more.

I live in Pittsburgh with my amazing wife and our two dogs. I like collecting vinyl records, experimenting with music technology, and playing (mostly Nintendo) games.
